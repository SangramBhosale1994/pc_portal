Diversity brings differences that can help teams and thus companies succeed in the projects. Achieving diversity, however, is not an easy task. The differences in the people, their thoughts and ways of work will bring about lot of challenges in the work but the end result is always rewarding.
Despite the obvious advantages, companies are not making enough efforts to bring about the numbers that show a healthy diversity in the workplace. By removing labels, not placing people in boxes and making efforts to remove unconscious bias with proper awareness, companies can bring healthy diversity and reap its benefits.",Bengaluru,KA,India,2021-10-08 17:57:54 +0530,https://www.thepridecircle.com/allychallenge/servicenow/,,India,true

Equitable employers outpace their competitors by respecting the unique needs, perspectives and potential of all their team members. As a result, diverse and inclusive workplaces earn deeper trust and more commitment from their employees.

Diversity and inclusion are two interconnected concepts—but they are far from interchangeable. Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is about how well the contributions, presence and perspectives of different groups of people are valued and integrated into an environment.

An environment where many different genders, races, nationalities, and sexual orientations and identities are present but only the perspectives of certain groups are valued or carry any authority or influence, may be diverse, but it is not inclusive.

Having an inclusive workplace culture will not only help you attract a diverse set of talent but also help you retain the diverse talent you attracted in the first place.",Bengaluru,KA,India,2021-10-08 11:07:05 +0530,https://www.thepridecircle.com/allychallenge/servicenow/,,India,true

Nikita Swain,Nikita,Swain,nikita.swain@servicenow.com,Valid,Have you ever faced exclusion or witnessed someone facing exclusion?: Share your reflections and insights in not more than 300 words.,25,"It came to my mind that I have never asked this question myself. But yes, it is very important to stop, look back at your life, analyse where we started and what we are heading towards.The journey of my life has been good for the most parts. I have the most wonderful parents supporting me in all walks of life - be it my education, social life, cultural, outings etc. I have a few but beautiful  friends. I am a part of such a supportive and strong organisation surrounded by so many talented people.
I have seen a lot of stereotypes happening across school, society, colleges etc. I have seen my friends facing cultural stereotypes . It turned out that the person who was stereotyping the other  had only known few people belonging to the same culture, who happened to have not set a good impression on him.
We have to come with an open mind, but prepared to suspend disbelief in order to benefit from the usefulness of non-judgemental cultural generalisations. Encountering another culture and respecting rather than denying its differences from our own culture can be an enriching learning experience.
I personally believe  we all should remember - that one of the greatest intellectual challenges is to understand that a thing can be both true and untrue at the same time.",Mumbai,MH,India,2021-10-07 11:53:28 +0530,https://www.thepridecircle.com/allychallenge/servicenow/,,India,true
